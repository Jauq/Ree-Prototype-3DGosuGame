I, Tim Anfilofieff, started this project just to see what I could do with ruby code. I only just learned how to use it
late year 2017, and watned to try to do as much as I could to make a game.

I am using the Gosu ruby gem game engine to run my game.

The main character is named Ree, the Duke of Thieves.
The other characters are currently unnamed.
